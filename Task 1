A function needs a return statement. For example:

def calculation (x, y):
    result = x + y
    return result

Question 5. 
Considerations/Problems when designing a lottery app
Security would be a consideration - handles sensitive user information and financial transactions

Fairness - random number generation must be robust and verifable to ensure fairness

Scabilitiy - There may be lots of users trying to use the app at the same time or when there is a large
winning jackpot so the app must be able to handle high  levels of traffic. Measures such as load balancing or scaling 
could be implimented to reduce chance of crashing.

Regulatory compliance - lots of regulations in place so users must be able to confirm above 18, data protection also
There must be verification steps in order to fulfil these laws.
